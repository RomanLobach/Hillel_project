# Hillel_project

This progect is a pure HTML and CSS example of my coding. It's an adaptive and responsive design built with a Pixel Perfect requirements.

Design base for project: https://www.figma.com/file/BZqbHZWqR9nsusVGIvKwpv/ithillel-dec-2021(gr%2330-09-21)?node-id=0%3A1

Also, this project will be supplemented with the following features:
  - styles will be rebuld using preprocessors (using SCSS, mixins, variables etc);
  - in the places where the slider is laid out, a simple vanilla JS code will be implemented that performs the work of the sliders;
  - some bug fixes in layout;
